# Descriptions & attribution for my videos

I'm [Nathan](https://polarhive.ml). I make videos and talk about tech, privacy, tutorials on [libre software](https://polarhive.ml/blog/free-libre-software/) on this channel.

This channel is a portal/hub of all the videos I film & edit. When I got [started](https://polarhive.ml/blog/how-i-got-my-username/) in 2017 I used YouTube - which garnered north of 14k views and 52 total videos uploaded to that channel. Today, all those videos are archived, after deleting my main Google account. I'm starting fresh on decentralized platforms like [Odysee](https://polarhive.ml/odysee) and [PeerTube](https://polarhive.ml/peertube), I still have an archive of those old videos, reach out to me and I'd show you. P.S. (they were very cringy)

Follow me on [Mastodon](https://polarhive.ml/mastodon) and [Pixelfed](https://polarhive.ml/pixelfed) for other fun stuff!

## Where do you upload your videos?

- [LBRY / Odysee](https://polarhive.ml/odysee)
- [PeerTube [tilvids.com] (ActivityPub)](https://polarhive.ml/peertube)
- I also upload on YouTube but [don't want to bring people into centralized silos](https://polarhive.ml/blog/fedi-first)

## Why not write it in the description box itself?

1. I want to bring people away from YouTube - into privacy friendly, decentralized alternatives like the fediverse, LBRY and eventually self host my own PeerTube. Both protocols allow for decentralized hosting.
2. It's easier to manage it in one place like this repo than updating one video at a time on every single platform.
3. YouTube tracks outbound links in the description.
4. Helps me learn Git!
