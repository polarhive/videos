# Descriptions & attribution for my videos

Hi. I'm [Nathan](https://polarhive.ml). I make videos, talking about tech, privacy, tutorials, [libre software](https://polarhive.ml/blog/free-libre-software/) on this channel ~ polarhive

This channel is a portal/hub of all the videos I film & edit. When I got [started](https://polarhive.ml/blog/how-i-got-my-username/#youtube) in 2017. I used YouTube - which garnered [north of 14k views](https://polarhive.ml/username); 52 videos in total, uploaded to that channel. Today, all those videos are archived, after [deleting my main Google account](https://polarhive.ml/blog/degoogle). I'm starting fresh, now on decentralized platforms like [Odysee](https://polarhive.ml/odysee) & [PeerTube](https://polarhive.ml/peertube), documenting my life & all the fun projects I make along the way. I'm mirroring to YouTube for traffic, a week after they go up on PeerTube/Odysee. I still have an archive of those old videos, [reach out](https://polarhive.ml/contact) to me and I'd show you. P.S. (very cringy).

Follow me on [Mastodon](https://polarhive.ml/mastodon) & [Pixelfed](https://polarhive.ml/pixelfed); read my [blog](https://polarhive.ml/blog) for other fun stuff!

## Where can I watch your videos?

- [LBRY ~ odysee.com (decentralized)](https://polarhive.ml/odysee)
- [PeerTube ~ tilvids.com (decentralized)](https://polarhive.ml/peertube)
- I also upload on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/polarhive) but [don't want to bring people into centralized silos](https://polarhive.ml/blog/fedi-first)

### Why not write the description in the description box itself?

1. I want to bring people away from YouTube - siphon people into privacy friendly, decentralized alternatives like the PeerTube, LBRY & eventually self host my own content. Both protocols allow for decentralized hosting.
2. It's easier to manage it in one place like this repo than updating one video at a time on every single platform.
3. YouTube tracks outbound links in the description box.
4. Helps me learn Git!

### Attribution for generic files used in my videos?
