# WhatsApp is a proprietary messaging app developed for the Facebook Ecosystem

The Android client is censoring videos. Should WhatsApp have a say in what media I share with my friends? Is WhatsApp really end to end encrypted? Why does it scan this in the first place?
# deletefacebook #deletewhatsapp

Try it out on Android and preferably upload from my region (India) They might be A/B beta testing too. I tried it with my friends (Android/India) and they get the same errors.
