# Use uBlock Origin - for a bloat free web | FOSS adblocker

[uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) - is a [FOSS](https://polarhive.ml/blog/free-libre-software) content / adblocker to navigate the modern bloated web. A web based on 'advertising' is is not sustainable. 

Respect your audience, optimize your resources. You shouldn't need to download 30MB of JavaScript just to load a text article. Block ads, trackers, distractions, obscenities when surfing the web. Globally block domains from Facebook & Google, inspect what 3rd party requests websites are making.

Filter anti-user features like - YouTube's 'recommendations page' / other addictive sites; should you use them in the first place.
