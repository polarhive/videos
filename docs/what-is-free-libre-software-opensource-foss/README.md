# What is Free / Libre Software? | Open Source (FOSS)

The word 'Free' means freedom, not free of cost. Better represented by the French/Spanish word 'libre' or liberty. It's not the same as 'Open Source' or 'FOSS', that's a diluted term for free/libre software.

The 'freedom' to do what you want, how you want & for whatever purpose as you wish. The freedom to sell the software too! for any price or make as many copies as you wish and distribute it for gratis i.e. free of cost.

Freedom denying software is called 'proprietary software'. It limits your user freedom, often spies on you, prevents you from selling software, prevents you from using your computer on your own terms. In effect, you just rent it from the proprietor. e.g. DRM, Facebook, Discord, Zoom, Google Play Services, Windows, iOS, MacOS, etc and don't actually own your computer.

Most of the world runs on Free/Libre software these days, from cars, server, phones, shops, many enterprises, activists, governments & normal people like you and me, exercise our freedoms, every single day. This video talks about the ideas behind free-software & their implications that help drive modern society.
