# Jukebox: listen to your LastFM recommendations on linux

Listen to your LastFM recommendations on linux using: mpd, yt-dlp and
bash; without having to open a browser.

[Jukebox](https://polarhive.net/jukebox) is a quick little project I
made over the weekend. Feel free to contribute if you know bash!
