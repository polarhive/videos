# No WhatsApp did NOT scrap its Privacy Policy | May 15th Deadline
Honestly at this point Facebook is everywhere. If you think that you don't use Facebook you're probably wrong.
They lie about their concern for your privacy. Facebook has to try to appeal to advertisers and users. Advertisers pay Facebook. Money speaks ðŸ¤‘ - that doesn't go well.

WhatsApp is a part of Facebook, Instagram also is.
If you use these apps, you indirectly have a Facebook account. Your data is stored on their servers. Ever wondered why Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp go offline together after server issues? Well - they all run on Facebook servers and Facebook is an advertising company.
