# Hardening Brave Browser | Stop Using Google Chrome

Brave out of the box feels bloated and overwhelming. But has great privacy features turned on by default.
In this video we will harden Brave, add some extensions, configure some flags & make it look minimal. It offers perfect compatibility with Google Chrome plus by blocking ads it pricks Google's control over the ad-infested web. Although Brave has their controversial crypto 'BAT' it is turned off by default. Brave offers the best compatibility to privacy ratio when compared to the Tor Browser / Hardened Firefox.

### UPDATE: (October 2021)

Brave has added [custom-filterlist-subscriptions](https://brave.com/privacy-updates-10/) into its inbuilt adblock extension with a recent update
So add your filter lists to Brave's [adblock](brave://adblock) to reach feature parity with uBlock Origin. No need to run 2 extensions now ;)
Brave [white-lists their own ads](https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/master/brave-unbreak.txt) in their adblocker, make sure you disable that.
